The game looks nice but is not playable.  I think that the top priority should be to create the matching game.\n
At this point, the matching game is very easy.  We need to:\n
	[&#2713;] Create the grid of buttons\n
	[ ] Gather images to be used for matching\n
	[ ] Randomly assign an image to each button\n
	[ ] Create the flipping motion\n
	[ ] Create a system to check if two arbitrary tiles have the same image (I was thinking of using a hash map)\n
	[ ] Improve the general look and feel by creating: \n
		[ ] Play and pause\n
		[ ] Timer\n
		[ ] Score\n
		[ ] Restart\n
