The game looks nice but is not playable.  I think that the top priority should be to create the matching game.
At this point, the matching game is very easy.  We need to:
- [x] Create the grid of buttons
- [ ] Gather images to be used for matching
- [ ] Randomly assign an image to each button
- [ ] Create the flipping motion
- [ ] Create a system to check if two arbitrary tiles have the same image (I was thinking of using a hash map)
- [ ] Improve the general look and feel by creating:
  - [ ] Play and pause
  - [ ] Timer
  - [ ] Score
  - [ ] Restart
