The game looks nice but is not playable.  I think that the top priority should be to create the matching game.
At this point, the matching game is very easy.  We need to:
	[&#2713] Create the grid of buttons
	[ ] Gather images to be used for matching
	[ ] Randomly assign an image to each button
	[ ] Create the flipping motion
	[ ] Create a system to check if two arbitrary tiles have the same image (I was thinking of using a hash map)
	[ ] Create the general look and feel
		[ ] Play and pause
		[ ] Timer
		[ ] Score
		[ ] Restart
